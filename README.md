# Project Name: My First Project
This project is about creating a website focused on advertising baking classes to prospective customers and encouraging them to sign up in order to participate in these classes. The name of this company is BusyBakes. There are six parts that make up this website,all of which are displayed in the navigation bar. These parts are as followed:  “Home, Gallery, Schedule, Location, Sign Up and About Us”. All the webpages in this project are intuitive as they are easy for a user to understand and navigate through. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were all used in the making of this project. HTML and Bootstrap were both used to write up the contents of the webpages. Whilst CSS was used to design and structure a consistent layout throughout each webpage. These webpages were made to be responsive across multiple technology platforms including: smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops.

# UX
In conducting my UX process, I made use of ths 5 planes of user experience: 
* Strategy
* Scope
* Structure
* Skeleton
* Surface

## Strategy:
The aim of this project is to create a website for people looking into developing a new skill in baking. The website made in this project aims to attract people with its bright colours and images of baked goods as examples of what users could learn how to bake if they decided to join this company and convince them to do so. This is to make them learn more about the company i.e. its: lesson hours, location, price and history. The website also aims to provide users with a means to sign up with the company using its form service. The overall business objective of this website therefore is to get as many people as possible to sign up and attend their baking classes so they can make a financial profit from charging the membership fee. 

At this stage, it is worth ensuring that the gallery section of this project’s website displays real image examples of what has been made by current paying members of this business as this will serve as proof to the users of this site that a baking skill can be learnt with BusyBakes. In addition, it is imperative for these images to give users a positive experience when browsing through the website to entice them to sign up.The project’s web pages and technologies are culturally appropriate and has content which is relevant to the users. The content can also be tracked and catalogued in an intuitive way. 

A positive experience using this website is valuable because it can lead to an increase in the number of new customers that decide to sign up and join the baking classes. An increase in customers leads to an increase of a network of peers as they tell their friends and family about their positive experience with BusyBakes and encourage them to also sign up. This increases the total number of members paying into the business enabling them to make a profit. An increase in customers also increases the workload of the company’s employees and causes an increase in more employees that can be afforded to be hired. Thus, helping the employment rates reduce. 

Another value of this website is that with an increased customer base bringing in more profit, it increases the confidence of the company’s suppliers. Those that sell baking ingredients and equipment to BusyBakes will want to continue doing business with them or potentially even increase it as they become more confident in BusyBakes ability to make money, so they can pay them. 

## Scope:

## Structure:
For the interaction design, the patterns were kept consistent throughout each page of the project’s website. This was done to prevent confusing the user and allowing for an easy time of operating through the different pages of the website, preventing them from getting lost. 

For the information architecture, the sequences used were based in the navigation bar located at the top of each page. The order of the links were based on importance with the most important link “Home” appearing first and the “About us” link appearing last. This order of importance was based on what the user would most want to see in order to convince them to become a member.

All pages contain the same layout. This consistency with the layout helps the user quickly learn how to use the website and therefore have more time available to spend understanding what is being advertised to them. This leaves more opportunities for the company to sell themselves to these users and increase the likelihood of them signing up due to all the focus of the website being spent on them selling their business to these users. Also, the same content in their header and footer is used in each webpage. 

The header contains the logo and navigation bar and the footer contains contact and social link details. This is good structuring as users are always reminding of the company name which increases name recognition. Also, it makes it easy for them to navigate from one page to another without getting lost. The social links and contact details placed at the footer of each page helps avoid an unnecessary additional page called “Contact” from being created in the navigation bar. This also makes it easier for the user to use this website as well as its navigation bar. 

## Skeleton:
In this plane of the user experience, both interface and navigation design was focused on. The arrangement of how the website’s pages were to be presented was decided to produce a mockup using Balsamiq Wireframes. These wireframes consisted of a clear and easy to follow arrangement which was repeated on each page. These repeated arrangements and patterns reassured the users when operating through the site. They also consisted of creating a navigation bar at the top of each webpage that was easy to read, use and understand so intuitiveness could be harnessed by the users. These navigation bars at this stage enabled users to move from one page to another with minimal difficulty. Which helped them complete tasks including filling out the sign up form to join the baking classes. 

From these wireframes a minimum viable product version to the website was made and early users of the site got to experience working with it for a sert period of time. On completion, feedback was provided about the user's experience with the website. This feedback was used to improve the website to better help fulfill the needs of the user.

## Surface:
At this stage, the final version of the website was deployed onto the internet for the use of all users. All web pages contained a consistent and visual design with a range of features enabling users to carry out a range of different activities across all web pages. The web pages are easy to use and follow in an intuitive manner. All of them contain appropriate and adequate information. This amount of information doesn’t overwhelm the user and cause cognitive overload. Instead, its quantity is easy to digest and quick to learn, leaving more time for the user to pay more attention to the selling of the baking lesson service by the website.

# Features

## Existing Features
* Home -  Informs users that this is a company that teaches customers how to bake. Also, informs users on the cost of participating and provides links to navigate through different parts of the website. In addition, social links and contact details are provided so the user can further engage more with the company, outside of its website, should they choose to do so.  
* Gallery - Allows users to browse through different images of baked products, created by current customers of the company during the baking lessons. The aim of this feature is to entice users to want to join so they too can create the same baked products as seen in this gallery.
* Schedule - Provides users with information on opening times of the baking classes and the days they fall on. As well as a sign up link underneath to direct them to the sign up page.
* Location - Enables users to become informed of the company’s location in order to attend the baking classes if they decide to join.
* Sign Up - Permits users to register their personal details with the company so they can create an account to be contacted regarding joining the baking lessons.
